Making the board representation
    - Bitboard representation
    - Square representation

Creating Pieces as structs
    - Piece struct
        - PieceType
        - Color
        - Position

    - PieceType enum
        - Pawn
            - EnPassant
            - Promotion
        - Rook
            - Castling
        - Knight
        - Bishop
        - Queen
        - King
            - Castling

    - Color enum
        - White
        - Black
    
    - Position enum

Game State representation
    - GameState struct
        - Board
        - Turn
        - CastlingRights
        - EnPassantSquare
        - HalfMoveClock
        - FullMoveNumber

    - Should also contain FEN notation string

Bit board notes:
    Bit boards are used to generate the possible moves, that uses bitwise operations
    to generate the possible moves for a piece.
